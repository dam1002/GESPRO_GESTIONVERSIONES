Man really in the mood to draw some kind of sad 'symbolism' with Sharon

Basically I had this idea that you see two other 'Sharons' with this very creepy grin and they backstab the original. 

And after that you see a third show up. Sharon in her demon form. The demon form--
--'swallows' her. And Sharon keeps falling down. Seeing all of the people she's lost in the position she saw them in last. So if for example one of them had been st*bbed you'd see them like that.

They then start to chant to her some very horrible things. But... they've never--
--even said such things to her. Those horrible things they keep chanting are her own thoughts she keeps telling herself because of all the guilt she feels.

And then when she reaches the last person she had lost. Her childhood friend. (He was the only one not k*lled. He was--
--being t0rtured by her 'clone' to make him start fearing Sharon so he'd run away.) 

She finally wakes up from the nightmare crying and screaming.

Basically:
''You are your own worst enemy''
