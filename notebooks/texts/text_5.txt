“I still can’t believe this. I’m free. I can’t tell you how scary it’s been locked up during COVID w/ no end in sight. I'll now spend time w/ my family &amp; get my life back on track so I can help others like my other brother Lance, who's incarcerated in Southern California.”
Neko's brother, Jacque (@jacquewilson1), is a public defender in San Francisco. Fought tirelessly for over a year for justice for Neko. Still fighting for his other brother. “Neko has been a political prisoner of the war on drugs, the war on poor people &amp; war on Black People." https://t.co/zBEkhIENbA
In 2003, Neko was detained and searched for being a black passenger in a speeding car. Nobody could have predicted how the criminal injustice system was going to take away nearly half his life. Neko was 21 years old at the time the vehicle he was in got stopped.
Neko was racially profiled when the vehicle was illegally searched &amp; marijuana was found inside. The stop, search &amp; seizure were illegal but Neko was scared to risk prison. Like many young black men he took probation instead of fighting his case.
Neko's attorney, Lee Philips:  “It is not enough to talk about or hope for social and racial justice. You have to truly believe in it.  Most important, it is not enough to believe in it. You must work and sacrifice for it because justice is truth in action."
