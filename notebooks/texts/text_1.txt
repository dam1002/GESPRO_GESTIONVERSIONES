top feelings i recall from childhood:
fear/guilt
sense of indignation that my logic was being twisted
sense of not being listened to
sense that my intention was definitely pure/goodhearted and mistakes not intended (i knew my reasons well--hard to gaslight)
fighting for myself
top feelings continued:
sense that my parents hated me
sense that my parents were ashamed of me
sense that my parents would kill me or each other, or themselves, in the heat of the moment
sense that my parents were stupid
sense that my parents were immature
sense that my parents were bad people (using barbaric violent method to get a dog to not have an accident in a NEW PLACE?? it's just dumb! i was only a baby and i knew that)
my mom was 25 when she had me, good god, that's an ignorant age, i was literally in love with my professor and masturbating myself into a shoulder injury when i was that age, the brain isnt done growing at that age
