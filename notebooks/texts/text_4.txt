hey, does your 3d printer's extruder have HDMI in? 
no? WELL THERE'S PROBABLY A GOOD REASON FOR THAT https://t.co/ubqJjmJVlv
HDMI is just being used because it's a cheap widely available cable.
It's like all those PCI-e extenders that use USB 3.0 https://t.co/qosCxeONpZ
they don't REALLY use USB 3.0, but USB 3.0 cables are cheap and easy to get and they have the right shielding properties.

the only problem is that if you mix them up and plug PCIe-USB3.0 into USB3.0-USB3.0 you will probably explode both devices
similarly, it would be a Very Bad idea to plug that HDMI cable from your 3D printer into a TV
the worst part? the 3d printer includes a raspi running octoprint/octopi.
meaning IT HAS ANOTHER HDMI PORT, BUT THIS ONE IS REAL HDMI https://t.co/3NHJyuO9pH
better not mix those up or your 3d printer has just become an expensive 3d smoke generator
still, could be worse.
could be that PCI-e to PCI adapter that uses DVI cables for some reason

and at the end of the day, it's not the sex toy connector.
you don't want to know what they use to plug in sex toys into fucking machines.

but if you think you do, here's the thread that tells you what it is. I'm sorry.
